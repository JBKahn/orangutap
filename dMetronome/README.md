==========
dMetronome is developed by Digutsoft and DMMetronome.java file is a copy of [android-metronome](https://code.google.com/p/android-metronome/source/browse/trunk/src/org/coolfrood/mytronome/TickPlayer.java).

dMetronome is a metronome app runs in Android Wear.
It is an only metronome for Android Wear.

Set BPM with slider, and set accurate BPM with buttons.
After setting BPM, start metronome. Then, your watch will vibrate in the BPM.

And also this is the first open-source project of [Digutsoft](http://www.digutsoft.com) and I'm not very good at using Git, so there can be lots of mistakes in Git. If you find them, please notice me! :D
